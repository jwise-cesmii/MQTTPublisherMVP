# MQTTPublisherMVP
Fork of [Minimum Viable Product for an MQTT-based OPC UA PubSub Publisher for industrial cloud telemetry](https://github.com/barnstee/MQTTPublisherMVP) to use a local MQTT broker for simplicity.

This project demonstrates how to read from a OPC UA server and write to a MQTT broker.
